            Coder Dojo is a international movement of computer programming clubs for kids / by kids. You can read
            all about it <a href="https://coderdojo.com/movement/">here</a>. Your student's dojo meets after school on 
            Thursdays, but there are other ones that meet through out the city all the time. Feel free to check some 
            of those out as well. There is also a state wide hackathon hosted by Coder Dojo Indiana, the statewide
            organization that lives inside of Techpoint Foundation for youth.

            Your student will start programming in a visual programmming environment called Scratch which is created and 
            maintained by MIT. We will provide them with a scratch login and some getting started material via Google's
            CS First program. Scratch is just the tip of the iceberg. Since the students are mostly under the age of 13, 
            we need your help establishing an accoutn for them on a website called <strong>Github</strong>.  <strong>Github</strong> is free for our use
            and it has become kind of the defacto open source tool for the entire internet. A <strong>Github</strong> account will allow your
            student to access a more robust environment called <strong>codeanwhere.com</strong> and another service that we'll use called
            <strong>glitch.com</strong>. It will also give your student a durable place to save their work and share their projects. Please see below
            for a more detailed explanation of each service / tool.
