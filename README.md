CFI 2 Coder Dojo Site
=====================

Hey you,

We want you to make this site your own. We want you to make experiments with web technologies, we want you to link
to your scratch projects, your glitch projects, your github repos. We want you to make videos of other things you do
and embed them here. The only thing we don't want you to do is mess with parents.html and how to get to it from them
home page, because that is important for new dojo members.

Remember our rules:

- Be cool.
- Have Fun.
- Ask three and then an adult.

Thanks,

Your Coder Dojo Adults.
